      You could try abstracting all the routes into a seperate component, then doing this:

        <Route path='/*' element={<MyRoutes />} />

      Generally, that works, but an issue arises for routes that use the loader prop.
      I believe the routes that use loader must be implemented inside of the
      router (i.e., not abstracted). Otherwise you get an error:

        TypeError: Cannot destructure property 'data' of 'loaderData' as it is undefined.

      See here for more info on that:

        https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/issues/9377
        https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/issues/9362
        It seems that loader function are not called from within nested routes.
        "Descendant <Routes> trees do not participate in data loading."

      The new <Navigate> element in v6 works like a declarative version of the useNavigate() hook.
      It's particularly handy in situations where you need a React element to declare your navigation intent,
      like <Route element>. It also replaces any uses that you had for a <Redirect> element in v5 outside of a <Switch>.

      The <Navigate replace> prop tells the router to use history.replaceState() when updating the URL so the / entry won't
      end up in the history stack. This means that when someone clicks the back button, they'll end up at the page they were
      at before they navigated to /. */}

        React Router is smart enough to first match the route that is more specific.

      {/* Nested Routes:
        Think of AboutDavid and AboutHolly as parts of the AboutPage that are
        conditionally rendered in AboutPage based on the rest of the URL fragment.
        Where the component gets rendered is dependent on where <Outlet /> is placed.
        The AboutPage also has subnavigation for viewing these components.
